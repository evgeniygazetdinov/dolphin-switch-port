Dolphin is an emulator for running GameCube and Wii games on Windows,
Linux, macOS, and recent Android devices. It's licensed under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (GPLv2+).

Please read the [FAQ](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/) before using Dolphin.

## System Requirements

### Desktop

* OS
    * Windows (10 or higher).
    * Linux.
    * macOS (10.15 Catalina or higher).
    * Unix-like systems other than Linux are not officially supported but might work.
* Processor
    * A CPU with SSE2 support.
    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.
* Graphics
    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 3.3).
    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.



The "Release" solution configuration includes performance optimizations for the best user experience but complicates debugging Dolphin.
The "Debug" solution configuration is significantly slower, more verbose and less permissive but makes debugging Dolphin easier.


## Building for Nintendo Switch

devkitPro and libnx are required.

Then use `aarch64-none-elf-cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$DEVKITPRO/cmake/Switch.cmake` as `cmake`.

differences from original build:
- removed support requests(curl) need to fix in future
- implemented sdl2 gui approach instead of qt gui. just becouse it simpler right now.


## Command Line Usage

```
Usage: Dolphin.exe [options]... [FILE]...

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user=USER  User folder path
  -m MOVIE, --movie=MOVIE
                        Play a movie file
  -e <file>, --exec=<file>
                        Load the specified file
  -n <16-character ASCII title ID>, --nand_title=<16-character ASCII title ID>
                        Launch a NAND title
  -C <System>.<Section>.<Key>=<Value>, --config=<System>.<Section>.<Key>=<Value>
                        Set a configuration option
  -s <file>, --save_state=<file>
                        Load the initial save state
  -d, --debugger        Show the debugger pane and additional View menu options
  -l, --logger          Open the logger
  -b, --batch           Run Dolphin without the user interface (Requires
                        --exec or --nand-title)
  -c, --confirm         Set Confirm on Stop
  -v VIDEO_BACKEND, --video_backend=VIDEO_BACKEND
                        Specify a video backend
  -a AUDIO_EMULATION, --audio_emulation=AUDIO_EMULATION
                        Choose audio emulation from [HLE|LLE]
```

Available DSP emulation engines are HLE (High Level Emulation) and
LLE (Low Level Emulation). HLE is faster but less accurate whereas
LLE is slower but close to perfect. Note that LLE has two submodes (Interpreter and Recompiler)
but they cannot be selected from the command line.

Available video backends are "D3D" and "D3D12" (they are only available on Windows), "OGL", and "Vulkan".
There's also "Null", which will not render anything, and
"Software Renderer", which uses the CPU for rendering and
is intended for debugging purposes only.
